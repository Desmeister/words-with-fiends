C++ Program to Cheat at Word Streak With Friends

This program takes in a 16 character string representing the game board, and draws all the words onto the board.

It runs using Windows.h so is only windows compatible. The resolution must be 1920x1080 with the WSWF running
in the left half of the screen. The program can not yet deal with board resets and must be relaunched.
